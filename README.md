# Multi-Tenant Budget SaaS
## Department Budget & Spend Governance Platform

### Overview

Multi-Tenant Budget SaaS is a Django-based platform designed to model how modern organisations manage departmental budgets, spending requests, and approval workflows within a multi-tenant SaaS architecture.

The goal of this project is to move beyond basic CRUD applications and explore more complex business-rule modelling, organisational data isolation, and structured financial governance logic.

This system is being built as a portfolio-level architecture project to demonstrate SaaS-ready backend design, role-based permissions, workflow state management, and real-world business modelling.

---

### Project Objectives

- Design a multi-tenant architecture where organisations are fully isolated
- Model departments with allocated budgets and controlled spending
- Implement structured approval workflows based on business rules
- Track committed vs actual spend to simulate real financial controls
- Enforce role-based access control across different user types
- Build with scalability and SaaS-style extensibility in mind

This project focuses on architectural thinking, not just feature building.

---

### Why This Project

In many organisations, departmental spending is managed through spreadsheets, emails, or chat-based approvals. This often leads to:

- Limited real-time budget visibility
- No structured approval routing
- Weak audit trails
- Overspending detected too late
- Poor financial accountability

This platform aims to simulate how a properly designed SaaS system could introduce structured governance, visibility, and accountability into departmental budget management.

### Architectural Focus

The emphasis of this project is on:

- Multi-tenant data modelling
- Organisational scoping and isolation
- Conditional workflow logic
- Role-based permission systems
- Auditability and traceability
- Clean, production-style project structure

The feature set will evolve as the architecture develops.

---

### Status

Early architecture and modelling phase.
Core data structures and tenant design are currently being planned and implemented.

---

### Long-Term Vision

This project is intended to represent a step toward SaaS-level product architecture, with potential future expansion into subscription modelling, advanced reporting, and enterprise-style financial tooling.
